# README

Hello folks! This is one of my very first (official) projects for my future resume/portfolio. 
For the realisation I am using the CSS Framework - MaterializeCss.

PLEASE NOTE THAT I AM A COMPLETELY BEGINNER WHILE DOING THIS, SO THE CODE COULD BE A LITTLE BIT OF A STRUGGLE.

Copyright (c) 2021 hinzzx_;

To this date, with the premission of MaterializeCSS, to legally use their software to create, modify, sell, etc. - I am making this project.


I will add their license file, under this one for your best convenience.

HOWEVER, THE PREMISSION FOR THE USAGE OF THIS PROJECT, MODIFY, COPY OR ELSE UNDER ANY CONDITIONS OF SOMEONE WHOM ISNT ME, ITS FORBIDDEN (FOR NOW).
