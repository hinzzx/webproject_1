# README



Hello folks! This is one of my very first touch of anything else than pure HTML & CSS, after learning basics of 'em. Don't laugh please xd!
For the realisation I am using the CSS Framework - _MaterializeCss._

PLEASE NOTE THAT I AM A COMPLETELY BEGINNER WHILE DOING THIS, SO THE CODE COULD BE A LITTLE BIT OF A STRUGGLE TO READ. 

```  NOTE: I WAS JUST EXPLORING MATERIALIZECSS' COMPONENTS AND THEIR POSSIBILITIES!```
